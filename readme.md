# Links app

Hi there 👋🏼  
This is a tipically CRUD app to save links, you can save it add a description and access to then. To see just the links you saved I decided to make the user to register and login in the app.

- ✅ Save links in database
- ✅ No usernames repeated in DB
- ✅ Endpoints secured 🔐
- ✅ User session control
